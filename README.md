# Cluster bomb :warning:
Final project for the course Data Visualization at EPFL. [Go to website](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/project-2023-yeravizard/)

### Introduction :bulb:
In this data visualization project, we will unravel the different characteristics that define and differentiate terrorist groups. Through data visualization techniques we aim to investigate how terrorist groups from different ideologies differ. This project will discuss geographical patterns, ideological affiliations, evolution over time, weapons, targets, and operational strategies of terrorist groups. By directing our focus toward the differences between ideologies, we aim to explore how distinct belief systems shape the formation, objectives, and modus operandi of various terrorist groups.

### Data :memo:

Our work will revolve around the extensively studied and impressively rich [GTD](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). This publicly available dataset was collected and is still maintained by the [National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism](https://www.start.umd.edu) (START) at the University of Maryland in the United States. The GTD includes data on over 200,000 international terrorist attacks since 1970. Described as "the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist events in the world" \cite{GReVD}, the GTD contains information on over 100 features for each terrorist attack, including the location, date, attacker(s), target(s), weapons used, casualties and terrorist organization. 

We aim to direct our analysis at the group behavior of terrorist organizations. To do so, we pair the GTD  with another complementary dataset by START, called the [Profiles of Perpetrators of Terrorism in the United States](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl%3A1902.1/17702) (PPT-US). This database describes 145 terrorist organizations having engaged in terrorist activity in the United States between 1970 and 2016. From their own description, each organization's "terrorist attacks, its history and base of operations, its ideology and goals, its engagement in political and criminal activities (other than terrorism), its alliances, its network and structure, and its financial resources." A confidence indicator (*high*/*medium*/*low*) is included for each information to reflect the reliability of each information.
