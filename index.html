	<!-- PART 1: OVERVIEW -->
	<div class="text_container" id="overview">
		<h3> Introduction </h3>
			<p> Our work will revolve around the extensively studied and impressively rich 
				<a style="color:cadetblue; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd">Global Terrorism Database</a>. 
				The GTD includes data on over 200,000 international terrorist attacks since 1970 and has information on over 100 features for each terrorist attack. 
				We direct our analysis at the differences between terrorist groups with different ideologies. We start by providing a geographical overview of terrorist attacks. Afterwards, we consider how the ideological background of terrorists has evolved over time. Then, we dive into how terrorist groups from different ideologies differ.</p> 
				<h3>Mapping terrorism: where <em> hate</em> strikes.</h3>
			
			<p>Let us start with our geographical overview of terrorist attacks. Below, you can see an interactive map, made through
			<a style="color:cadetblue; font-weight: bold;" href="https://kepler.gl">Kepler.gl</a>. This map contains arcs connecting the country of origin of each terrorist group to the location of their attacks. The blue end of the arc indicates the country of origin of the terrorist group, while the red end of the arc indicates the location of the attack.
			What can you discover in the graph? </p>

	<!-- PART 2: IDEOLOGY -->

	<!-- 2.1. NUM ATTACKS PER IDEOLOGY -->

<div class="text_container">
	<h3> Ideologies and terrorism </h3>
		<p> In this section, we investigate the four major ideologies to which the groups belong: ethno-nationalists,
			religious-driven, extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing. Besides these four major ideologies, we also
			consider single-issue terrorist groups. Let us start by providing some brief definitions:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Ethno-nationalists: </b> Generally speaking, ethno-nationalists consider their nation to be defined
				by their ethnicity. Therefore, inhabitants with a different ethnic background may be considered as
				inferior.
				The attacks of these groups are aimed at preserving or asserting the dominance of an ethnic group in the
				nation.</li>
			<li><b>Religious-driven: </b> Religious-driven terrorist groups are motivated by a strict adherence to a
				particular interpretation of religious
				ideology, often seeking to establish a society governed by their religious principles. They view their
				acts of terrorism
				as a means to defend or advance their religious beliefs, enforce religious purity, or resist perceived
				threats to their
				faith. </li>
			<li><b>Extreme left-wing: </b> Extreme left-wing terrorist groups are typically driven by radical ideologies
				rooted in Marxism, socialism, or other
				forms of anti-capitalism. They seek to dismantle existing societal structures, often through violent
				means, in order to
				establish a classless and egalitarian society. Their motivations stem from perceived economic, social,
				and political
				injustices, with the belief that revolutionary violence is necessary to bring about systemic change.
			</li>
			<li><b>Extreme right-wing: </b> Extreme right-wing terrorist groups are motivated by ideologies that tend to
				be radically conservative, nationalist and xenophobic. They seek to preserve or restore what they
				perceive as their racial or ethnic identity, often through
				violent means. Their actions are driven by a belief in the superiority of their own group and a desire
				to exclude or
				target perceived threats, such as minority groups, immigrants, or those they consider to be cultural or
				ideological
				adversaries.</li>
			<li><b>Single issue</b>: single issue terrorist groups are motivated by a singular cause or concern, often centered around a specific issue or
			ideology. They engage in acts of terrorism to draw attention to and further their cause, which can range from animal
			rights, environmental activism, anti-abortion, or other highly focused objectives.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p> Let us first consider which of the ideologies is most prominent among terrorist groups, and how this has changed over time. The plot below shows that up to 2000, ethno-nationalist 
			terrorist groups were the most prevalent. However, at the turn of the century this shifted, and religious terrorist groups became most dominant. This has not changed during the past twenty years,
			although the overall number of group attacks has decreased over the past 5 years.

		<h3> Unveiling terror's tactics and targets</h3>
		<p> We will now consider the different attack types and targets. The sunburst diagram below shows how attack strategy differs by ideology.

		<h3> Motives Unmasked: Delving into the Mindset of Terrorist Organizations </h3>
		<p> In this section, we will dive deeper into the motivations of terrorist groups with different ideologies. The packing chart below shows for each ideology, what the main motives 
			of terrorist groups are. The motives are seperated into four categories: political, social, religious and economic. The size of the bubbles indicates the number of attacks that belong to the corresponding category. 
		Do you notice certain patterns in the data? For instance, one can observe that irrespective of the ideology, the most common motives of terrorist groups are of a political nature. What else can you discover? </p>
